# PhpTask

### Customers Within the Given Kilometer Range
Here , I have created two Function in customers_in_km.php to implement the task.

First function read the json formated data from the .txt file and return the customer name and user_id. Second function is calculating the distance from Dublin to customer's location using latitude and longitude.  

index.php file will shows the desired output 

Run this module from www/html folder in linux in any folder name.
This will show you its desired output.
